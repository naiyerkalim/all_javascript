////What is node js
//Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a 
//JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, 
//which was designed to build scalable network applications. 
///its built twice as fast with fewer people, 33% fewer lines of code and 40% less files.

//npx is a handy companion to npm, designed to execute packages or tools directly without global installation, making it especially useful for temporary tasks and project-specific executions.
