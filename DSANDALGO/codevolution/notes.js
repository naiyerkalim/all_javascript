///Algorithm
  //An algorithm is a set of well defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

///Why Algorithm?
   //as a developer, you are going to come across problems that you need to solve.
  //learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems.
  //one problem can be solve in many ways using different algorithms.
  //Every algorithmcomes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance.

//Algorithm analysis condt.
  //The absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted, since it depends on a number of factors.
   //programming language used to implement the algorithm.
   //The computer the programs runs on.
   //other programs running at the same time.
   //Quality of operating systems. 
  //We evaluate the performance of an algorithmin terms of its input size.

//Asymptonic notation
  //Mathematics tools to represent time and space complexity.
   //1. Big O Notation(O-notation) - worst case complexity.
   //2. Omega Notation(Ω-notation) - Best case complexity.
   //3. Theta Notation(ϴ-notation) -average case complexity.
  //O(n): linear time copmexity
  //O(1): constant time copmexity
  //O(n^2): Quadratic time copmexity.
  //O(n^3): Cubic time copmexity.
  //O(logn)- Logarithmic: input size reduces by half every iteration
